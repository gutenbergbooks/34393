<p>The friends of the late Commodore <span class="smcap">Decatur</span>, have learned, with very great regret, that misconceptions injurious
to him prevail, and are extending, relative to the
difference between him and Commodore <span class="smcap">Barron</span>. To
place the subject in its true light, they have thought it
necessary to submit to the public, without comment, the
whole correspondence which preceded the meeting.</p>

With respect to the date of this letter, it may be proper to
observe, that, although it is 12th June, yet the figure 2, as made,
might well be mistaken for a 3: hence, in Commodore Decatur's letter of
reply, he considered the date to be 13th June. On referring, however, to
the post mark on the back of the letter, it was found to have been put
into the post office on the 12th: hence, in Commodore Decatur's letter
to Commodore Barron, of the 31st October, 1819, it is recognized as
dated on the 12th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I have received your communication of the 13th instant. Before
you could have been entitled to the information you have asked of
me, you should have given up the name of your informer. That frankness
which ought to characterize our profession required it. I shall not,
however, refuse to answer you on that account, but shall be as candid in
my communication to you as your letter or the case will warrant.</p>

<p>Whatever I may have <i>thought, or said, in the very frequent and free
conversation I have had respecting you and your conduct</i>, I feel a thorough
conviction that I never could have been guilty of so much egotism as to
say that "<i>I</i> could insult you" (or any other man) "with impunity."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Your communication of the 17th instant, in answer to mine of
the 13th, I have received.</p>

<p>The circumstances that urged me to call on you for the information requested
in my letter, would, I presume, have instigated you, or any other
person, to the same conduct that I pursued. Several gentlemen in Norfolk,
not your enemies, nor actuated by any malicious motive, told me
that such a report was in circulation, but could not now be traced to its
origin. I, therefore, concluded to appeal to you, supposing, under such
circumstances, that I could not outrage any rule of decorum or candor.
This, I trust, will be considered as a just motive for the course I have
pursued. Your declaration, if I understand it correctly, relieves my mind
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;4]</span>
from the apprehension that you had so degraded my character, as I had
been induced to allege.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I have received your communication of the 25th, in answer to
mine of the 17th, and, as you have expressed yourself doubtfully, as to
your correct understanding of my letter of the aforesaid date, I have now
to state, and I request you to understand distinctly, that I meant <i>no more</i>
than to disclaim the <i>specific</i> and <i>particular</i> expression to which your inquiry
was directed, to wit: that I had said that <i>I</i> could insult you with impunity.
As to the motives of the "several gentlemen in Norfolk," your informants,
or the rumors which "cannot be traced to their origin," on which their
information was founded, or who they are, is a matter of perfect indifference
to me, as is also your motives in making such an inquiry upon such
information.</p>

<p class="h2">No. 5</p>

<p class="right">HAMPTON, OCTOBER 23, 1819.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I had supposed that the measure of your ambition was nearly
completed, and that your good fortune had rendered your reputation for
acts of magnanimity too dear to be risked wantonly on occasions that can
never redound to the honor of him that would be great. I had also concluded
that your rancor towards me was fully satisfied, by the cruel and
unmerited sentence passed upon me by the court of which you were a
member; and, after an exile from my country, family, and friends, of
nearly seven years, I had concluded that I should now be allowed, at
least, to enjoy that solace, with this society, that lacerated feelings like
mine required, and that you would have suffered me to remain in quiet
possession of those enjoyments; but, scarcely had I set my foot on my
native soil, ere I learnt that the same malignant spirit which had before
influenced you to endeavor to ruin my reputation was still at work, and
that you were ungenerously traducing my character whenever an occasion
occurred which suited your views, and, in many instances, not much to
your credit as an officer, through the medium of our juniors; such conduct
cannot fail to produce an injurious effect on the discipline and subordination
of the navy. A report of this sort, sir, coming from the respectable
and creditable sources it did, could not fail to arrest my attention,
and to excite those feelings which might naturally be expected to arise in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;5]</span>
the heart of every man who professes to entertain principles of honor,
and intends to act in conformity with them. With such feelings I addressed
a letter to you under date of the 13th June last, which produced
a correspondence between us, which I have since been informed you have
endeavored to use to my farther injury, by sending it to Norfolk by a
respectable officer of the navy, to be shewn to some of my particular
friends, with a view of alienating from me their attachment. I am also
informed, that you have tauntingly and boastingly observed, that you
would cheerfully meet me in the field, and hoped I would yet act like a
man, or that you had used words to that effect: such conduct, sir, on the
part of any one, but especially one occupying the influential station under
the government which you hold, towards an individual, situated as I am,
and oppressed as I have been, and that chiefly by your means, is unbecoming
you as an officer and a gentleman; and shews a want of magnanimity
which, hostile as I have found you to be towards me, I had hoped
for your own reputation you possessed. It calls loudly for redress at
your hands: I consider you as having given the invitation, which I accept,
and will prepare to meet you at such time and place as our respective
friends, hereafter to be named, shall designate. I also, under all the circumstances
of the case, consider myself entitled to the choice of weapons,
place, and distance; but, should a difference of opinion be entertained
by our friends, I flatter myself, from your known personal courage, that
you would disdain any unfair advantage, which your superiority in the
use of the pistol, and the natural defect in my vision, increased by age,
would give you. I will thank you not to put your name on the cover of
your answer, as, I presume, you can have no disposition to give unnecessary
pain to the females of my family.</p>

<p class="center">I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="right">JAMES BARRON.</p>

<p>Commodore <span class="smcap">Stephen Decatur</span>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Washington</i>.</span></p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="h2">No. 6</p>

<p class="right">WASHINGTON, OCTOBER 31, 1819.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Your letter of the 23d inst. has been duly received. Prior to
giving it that reply which I intend, its contents suggest the necessity of
referring to our June correspondence.</p>

<p>On the 12th June last, you addressed to me a note, inquiring whether I
had said that "I could insult you with impunity." On the 17th June, I
wrote you, in reply, as follows: "Whatever I may have <i>thought or said
in the very frequent and free conversations I have had respecting you and
your conduct</i>, I feel a thorough conviction that I never could have been
guilty of so much egotism, as to say that <i>I</i> could insult you, or any other
man, with impunity."</p>

<p>On the 25th of June, you again wrote to me, and stated, that the report
on which you had grounded your query of 12th June, "could not now be
traced to its origin," and your letter is concluded in the following words:
"your declaration, if I understand it correctly, relieves my mind from
the apprehension that you had so degraded my character, as I had been
induced to allege." Immediately on receiving your letter of the 25th of
June, I wrote to you, 29th June, as follows: "As you have expressed
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;6]</span>
yourself doubtfully as to your correct understanding of my letter of the
17th June, I have now to state, and I request you to understand, distinctly,
that I meant <i>no more</i> than to disclaim the <i>specific</i> and <i>particular</i> expression,
to which your inquiry was directed, to wit: "that I had said that
I could insult you with impunity." Here ended our June correspondence,
and, with it all kind of communication, till the date of your letter of the
23d inst. which I shall now proceed to notice.</p>

<p>Nearly four months having elapsed since the date of our last correspondence,
your letter was unexpected to me, particularly as the terms
used by you, in the conclusion of your letter to me of 25th June, and
your silence since receiving my letter of the 29th June, indicated, as I
thought, satisfaction on your part. But, it seems that you consider
yourself aggrieved by my sending our June correspondence to Norfolk.
I did not send the June correspondence to Norfolk, until three months
had expired after your last communication, and not then, until I had been
informed by a captain of the navy, that a female of your acquaintance had
stated, that such a correspondence had taken place.<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2">
</a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
If that correspondence
has, in any degree, "alienated your friends from you," such effect
is to be attributed to the correspondence itself. I thought the papers
would speak for themselves, and sent them without written comment.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

</a> See the extracts from Capt. Carter's letter, post. page 13.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>With respect to the court martial upon you for the affair of the Chesapeake,
to which you have been pleased to refer, I shall not treat the officers,
who composed that court, with so much disrespect, as to attempt a
vindication of their proceedings. The chief magistrate of our country
approved them; the nation approved them; and the sentence has been
carried into effect. But, sir, there is a part of my conduct, on that occasion,
which it does not appear irrelevant to revive in your recollection.
It is this; I was present at the court of inquiry upon you, and heard the
evidence then adduced for and against you; thence I drew an opinion
altogether unfavorable to you; and, when I was called upon, by the Secretary
of the Navy, to act as a member of the court martial ordered for
your trial, I begged to be excused the duty, on the ground of my having
formed such an opinion. The honorable Secretary was pleased to insist
on my serving; still anxious to be relieved from this service, I did, prior
to taking my seat as a member of the court, communicate to your able advocate,
general Taylor, the opinion I had formed, and my correspondence
with the Navy Department upon the subject, in order to afford you an
opportunity, should you deem it expedient, to protest against my being a
member, on the ground of my not only having formed, but <i>expressed</i>
an opinion unfavorable to you. You did not protest against my being a
member. Duty constrained me, however unpleasant it was, to take my
seat as a member; I did so, and discharged the duty imposed upon me.
You, I find, are incapable of estimating the motives which guided my conduct
in this transaction.</p>

<p>For my conduct as a member of that court martial, I do not consider
myself as, in any way, accountable to <i>you</i>. But, sir, you have thought fit
to deduce, from your impressions of my conduct as a member of that
court martial, inferences of personal hostility towards you. Influenced
by feelings thence arising, you commenced the June correspondence, a
correspondence which I had hoped would have terminated our communications.</p>

<p>Between you and myself there never has been a personal difference;
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;7]</span>
but I have entertained, and do still entertain the opinion, that your conduct
as an officer, since the affair of the Chesapeake, has been such as
ought to forever bar your readmission into the service.</p>

<p>In my letter to you, of the 17th June, although I disavowed the <i>particular
expressions</i> to which you invited my attention, candor required that
I should apprise you of my not having been silent respecting you. I informed
you that I had had <i>very frequent and free conversations respecting
you and your conduct</i>; and the words were underscored, that they might
not fail to attract your particular attention. Had you have asked what
those frequent and free conversations were, I should, with the same frankness,
have told you; but, instead of making a demand of this kind, you
reply to my letter of 17th June, "That my declaration, if correctly understood
by you, relieved your mind," &amp;c. That you might correctly understand
what I did mean, I addressed you as before observed, on the 29th
June, and endeavored, by <i>underscoring</i> certain precise terms, to convey
to you my precise meaning. To this last letter I never received a reply.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, I have judged it expedient at this time, to
state, as distinctly as may be in my power, the facts upon which I ground
the unfavourable opinion which I entertain, and have expressed, of your
conduct as an officer, since the court martial upon you; while I disclaim
all personal enmity towards you.</p>

<p>Some time after you had been suspended from the service, for your
conduct in the affair of the Chesapeake, you proceeded, in a merchant
brig, from Norfolk to Pernambuco; and by a communication from the
late Captain Lewis, whose honor and veracity were never yet questioned,
it appears&mdash;that you stated to Mr. Lyon, the <i>British consul</i> at Pernambuco,
with whom you lived, "That if the Chesapeake had been prepared
for action, you would not have resisted the attack of the Leopard;
assigning, as a reason, that you knew, (as did also our government,) there
were deserters on board your ship; that the President of the United
States knew there were deserters on board, and of the intention of the
British to take them; and that the President caused you to go out in a
defenceless state, for the express purpose of having your ship attacked
and disgraced, and thus attain his favorite object of involving the United
States in a war with Great Britain." For confirmation of this information,
Captain Lewis refers to Mr. Thomas Goodwin, of Baltimore, the
brother of Captain Ridgely of the Navy, who received it from Mr. Lyon
himself. Reference was made to Mr. Goodwin, who, in an official communication,
confirmed all that Captain Lewis had said. The veracity
and respectability of Mr. Goodwin are also beyond question. You will
be enabled to judge of the impression made upon Captain Lewis' mind,
by the following strong remarks he made on the subject:</p>

<p>"I am now convinced that Barron is a traitor, for I can call by no other
name a man who would talk in this way to an Englishman, and an Englishman
in office."</p>

<p>These communications are now in the archives of the Navy Department.</p>

<p>If, sir, the affair of the Chesapeake excited the indignant feelings of
the nation towards Great Britain; and was, as every one admits, one of
the principal causes which produced the late war, did it not behove you
to take an active part in the war, for your own sake?&mdash;Patriotism out of
the question! But, sir, instead of finding you in the foremost ranks, on
an occasion which so emphatically demanded your best exertions, it is
said, and is credited, that you were, after the commencement of the war,
to be found in the command of a vessel sailing under <i>British license</i>!
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;8]</span>
Though urged, by your <i>friends</i>, to avail yourself of some one of the opportunities
which were every day occurring in privateers, or other fast
sailing merchant vessels, sailing from France, and other places, to return
to your country during the war; it is not known that you manifested a
disposition to do so, excepting in the single instance by the <i>cartel</i> John
Adams, in which vessel, you must have known, you could not be permitted
to return, without violating her character as a cartel.</p>

<p>You say you have been oppressed. You know, sir, that, by absenting
yourself, as you did for years, from the country, without leave from the
government, you subjected yourself to be stricken from the rolls. You
know, also, that, by the 10th article of the act for the better government
of the Navy, all persons in the Navy holding intercourse with an enemy,
become subject to the severest punishment known to our laws. You have
not, for the offences before stated, to my knowledge, received even a reprimand;
and I do know, that your pay, even during your absence, has
been continued to you.</p>

<p>As to my having spoken of you injuriously to "junior officers," I have
to remark, that such is the state of our service that we have but few
seniors. If I speak with officers at all, the probability is, it will be with
a junior.</p>

<p>On your return to this country, your efforts to re-establish yourself in
the service were known, and became a subject of conversation with officers
as well as others. In the many and <i>free</i> conversations I have had
respecting you and your conduct, I have said, for the causes above enumerated,
that, in my opinion, you ought not to be received again into the
naval service; that there was not employment for all the officers who had
faithfully discharged their duty to their country in the hour of trial; and
that it would be doing an act of injustice to employ you, to the exclusion
of any one of them. In speaking thus, and endeavoring to prevent your
re-admission, I conceive that I was performing a duty I owe to the service;
that I was contributing to the preservation of its respectability.
Had you have made no effort to be re-employed, after the war, it is more
than probable I might not have spoken of you. If you continue your efforts,
I shall certainly, from the same feelings of public duty by which I
have hitherto been actuated, be constrained to continue the expression of
my opinions; and I can assure you, that, in the interchange of opinions
with other officers respecting you, I have never met with more than one
who did not entirely concur with me.</p>

<p>The objects of your communication of the 23d, as expressed by you,
now claim my notice. You profess to consider me as having given you
"an invitation." You say that you have been told, that I have "tauntingly
and boastingly observed, that I would cheerfully meet you in the
field, and hoped you would yet act like a man."</p>

<p>One would naturally have supposed, that, after having been so recently
led into an error by "rumors" which could not be traced, you would
have received, with some caution, subsequent rumors; at all events that
you would have endeavored to have traced them, before again venturing
to act upon them as if they were true. Had you have pursued this course,
you would have discovered, that the latter rumors were equally unfounded
as the former.</p>

<p>I never invited you to the field; nor have I expressed a hope that you
would call me out. I was informed by a gentleman with whom you had
conferred upon the subject, that you left Norfolk for this place, somtime
before our June correspondence, with the intention of calling me out. I
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;9]</span>
then stated to that gentleman, as I have to all others with whom I have
conversed upon the subject, that, if you made the call, I would meet you;
but that, on all scores, I should be much better pleased, to have nothing to
do with you. I do not think that fighting duels, under any circumstances,
can raise the reputation of any man, and have long since discovered, that
it is not even an unerring criterion of personal courage. I should regret
the necessity of fighting with any man; but, in my opinion, the man who
makes <i>arms his profession</i>, is not at liberty to decline an invitation from
any person, who is not so far degraded, as to be beneath his notice. Having
incautiously said I would meet you, I will not now consider this to be
your case, although many think so; and if I had not pledged myself, I
might reconsider the case.</p>

<p>As to "weapons, place, and distance," if we are to meet, those points
will, as is usual, be committed to the friend I may select on the occasion.
As far, however, as it may be left to me, not having any particular prejudice
in favor of any particular arm, distance, or mode, (but, on the contrary,
disliking them all,) I should not be found fastidious on those
points, but should be rather disposed to yield you any little advantage of
this kind. As to my skill in the use of the pistol, it exists more in your
imagination than in reality; for the last twenty years I have had but
little practice; and the disparity in our ages, to which you have been
pleased to refer, is, I believe, not more than five or six years. It would
have been out of the common course of nature, if the vision of either of
us had been improved by years.</p>

<p>From your manner of proceeding, it appears to me, that you have
come to the determination to fight some one, and that you have selected
me for that purpose; and I must take leave to observe, that your object
would have been better attained, had you have made this decision during
our late war, when your fighting might have benefitted your country as
well as yourself. The style of your communication, and the matter, did
not deserve so dispassionate and historical a notice as I have given it;
and had I believed it would receive no other inspection than yours, I
should have spared myself the trouble. The course I adopted with our
former correspondence, I shall pursue with this, if I shall deem it expedient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Commodore</span>: Nothing had transpired here previous to my
arrival, on the subject of the correspondence; but a Lady, a Miss &mdash;&mdash;,
I think her name is, from Hampton, has stated, that a correspondence had

The fears of this lady are at direct variance with the opinion of your

had passed between you and B. may I venture to ask you to send a copy
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;10]</span>
of them to Mr. Tazewell, who I have just left. He will, with great pleasure,

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Since my communication to you of the 31st ult. I have been informed
by a gentleman entitled to the fullest credit, that you were not
afloat till after the peace; consequently, the report which I noticed of
your having sailed under British license must be unfounded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Unavoidable interruption has prevented my answering your two

days you shall have my reply.</p>

<p class="right">HAMPTON, NOVEMBER 30, 1819.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I did not receive, until Tuesday, the 9th inst. your very lengthy,
elaborate, and historical reply, without date, to my letter to you of the
23d ultimo; which, from its nature and <i>object</i>, did not, I conceive, require
that you should have entered so much into detail, in defence of the hostile
and unmanly course you have pursued towards me, since the "affair of
the Chesapeake," as you term it. A much more laconic answer would
have served my purpose, which, for the present, is nothing more than to
obtain at your hands honorable redress for the accumulated insults which
you, sir, in particular, above all my enemies, have attempted to heap upon
me, in every shape in which they could be offered. Your last voluminous
letter is <i>alone</i> sufficient proof, if none other existed, of the rancorous
disposition you entertain towards me, and the extent to which you have
carried it. That letter I should no otherwise notice, than merely to inform
you it had reached me, and that I am prepared to meet you in the
field upon <i>any thing</i> like fair and equal grounds; but, inasmuch as you
have intimated that our correspondence is to go before the public, I feel
it a duty I owe to myself, and to the world, to reply particularly to the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;11]</span>
many calumnious charges and aspersions with which your "<i>dispassionate</i>
and historical notice" of my communication so abundantly teems; wishing
you, sir, at the same time, "distinctly to understand" that it is not
for <i>you</i> alone, or to justify myself in your estimation, that I take this
course. You have dwelt much upon our "June correspondence," as you
stile it, and have made many quotations from it. I deem it unnecessary,
however, to advert to it, further than to remark, that, although "nearly
four months" did intervene between that correspondence and my letter of
the 23d ultimo, my silence arose not from any misapprehension of the
purport of your contumacious "<i>underscored</i>" remarks, nor from the
malicious designs they indicated, nor from a tame disposition to yield
quietly to the operation which either might have against me; but, from a
tedious and painful indisposition, which confined me to my bed, the chief
part of that period, as is well known to almost every person here. I
anticipated, however, from what I had found you capable of doing to my
injury, the use to which you would endeavour to pervert that correspondence;
and have not at all been disappointed. So soon as I was well
enough, and heard of your machinations against me, I lost no time in
addressing to you my letter of the 23d ultimo; your reply to which I have
now more particularly to notice. I have not said, nor did I mean to convey
such an idea, nor will my letter bear the interpretation, that your
forwarding to Norfolk, our "June correspondence," had, "in any degree,
alienated my friends from me;" but, that it was sent down there with
<i>that view</i>. It is a source of great consolation to me, sir, to know, that I
have more friends, both in and out of the navy, than you are aware of;
and that it is not in your power, great as you may imagine your official
influence to be, to deprive me of their good opinion and affection. As to
the reason which seems to have prompted you to send that correspondence
to Norfolk, "that a female of my acquaintance had stated that such an
one had taken place," I will only remark, that she did not derive her information
from me: that it has always been, and ever will be, with me, a
principle, to touch as delicately as possible, upon reports said to come
from <i>females</i>, <i>intended</i> to affect injuriously the character of any one; and
that, in a correspondence like the <i>present</i>, highly as I estimate the sex, I
should never think of introducing <i>them</i> as authority. Females, sir, have
nothing, or ought to have nothing to do in controversies of this kind. In
speaking of the court martial which sat upon my trial, I have cast no imputation
or reflection upon the members individually who composed it
(saving yourself,) which required that you should attempt a vindication of
their proceedings; champion as you are, and hostile as some of them may
have been to me: nor does the language of my letter warrant any such
inference. I merely meant to point out to you, sir, what you appear to
have been incapable of perceiving: the indelicacy of your conduct, (to say
the least of it) in hunting me out as an object for malignant persecution,
after having acted as one of my judges, and giving your voice in favour of
a sentence against me, which I cannot avoid repeating, was "cruel and
unmerited." It is the privilege, sir, of a man, deeply injured as I have
been by that decision, and conscious of his not deserving it, as I feel myself,
to remonstrate against it; and I have taken the liberty to exercise
that privilege.</p>

<p>You say that "the proceedings of the Court have been approved by the
Chief Magistrate of our country, that the nation approved of them, and
that the sentence has been carried into effect." It is true the President
of the United States <i>did</i> approve of that sentence, and that it was carried
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;12]</span>
into effect&mdash;full and complete effect, which I should have supposed
ought to have glutted the envious and vengeful disposition of your heart;
but I deny that the nation has approved of that sentence, and as an appeal
appears likely to be made to <i>them</i>, I am willing to submit the question.
The part you took on that occasion, it was totally unnecessary, I assure
you, "to revive in my recollection;" it is indelibly imprinted on my mind,
and can never, while I have life, be erased. You acknowledge you were
present at the Court of Inquiry in my case, "heard the evidence for and
against me, and had, therefore, formed and expressed an opinion unfavorable
to me," and yet, your conscience was made of such pliable materials,
that, <i>because</i> the then "honorable Secretary of the Navy was <i>pleased
to insist</i> on your serving as a member of the Court Martial, and because <i>I</i>
did not protest against it," you conceive that "<i>duty constrained</i> you,
however unpleasant, to take your seat as a member," although you were
to act under the solemn sanction of an oath, to render me impartial justice
upon the very testimony which had been delivered in your hearing before
the Court of Inquiry, and from which you "drew an opinion, <i>altogether
unfavorable to me</i>." How such conduct can be reconciled with the principles
of common honor and justice, is to me inexplicable. Under such
circumstances, <i>no</i> consideration, no power or authority on earth, could,
or ought to, have forced any liberal high minded man to sit in a case which
he had prejudged, and, to retort upon you your own expressions, you must
have been "incapable of seeing the glaring impropriety of your conduct,
for which, although you do not conceive yourself in any way accountable
to <i>me</i>," I hope you will be able to account for it with your God, and your
conscience.</p>

<p>You say, between you and myself, there never has been a personal difference,
"and you disclaim all personal enmity towards me." If every
step you have taken&mdash;every word you have uttered, and every line you
have written, in relation to me&mdash;if your own admission of the very
frequent and free conversations you have had respecting me, and my
conduct, "since the affair of the Chesapeake," bear not the plainest
stamp of <i>personal hostility</i>, I know not the meaning of such terms;
were you not under the influence of feelings of this sort, why not, in your
official capacity, call me, or have me brought, before a proper tribunal, to
answer the charges you have preferred against me, and thereby giving me
a chance of defending myself? Why speak injuriously of me to <i>junior</i>
officers, "which you do not deny?" Why the "many frequent and free
conversations respecting me and my conduct," which you have taken so
much pains to underscore? Why use the insulting expression, that you
"entertained, and still do entertain, the opinion that my conduct, as an
officer, since that 'affair' has been such as ought forever to bar my readmission
into the service," and that, in endeavoring to prevent it, "you
conceive you were performing a duty you owe to the service, and were
contributing to its respectability?" Why the <i>threat</i>, that if I continued
the "efforts" <i>you</i> say I have been making, to be "re-employed" you "certainly
should be constrained to continue the expression of those opinions?"</p>

<p>Does not all this, together with the whole tenor and tendency of your
letter, manifest the most marked <i>personal</i> animosity against me, which an
honorable man, acting under a sense of public duty by which you profess
to "have been hitherto actuated," would disdain even to shew, much
more to feel?</p>

<p>I shall now, sir, take up the specific charges you have alleged against
me, and shall notice them in the order in which they stand. The first is
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;13]</span>
one of a very <i>heinous</i> character. It is, that "I proceeded in a merchant
brig to Pernambuco." Could I, sir, during the period of my suspension,
have gone any where in a national vessel? Could I, with what was due to
my family, have remained idle? The sentence of the Court deprived them
of the principal means of subsistence. I was therefore compelled to resort
to that description of employment with which I was best acquainted;
and on this subject <i>you</i> should have been silent. But you add, that the
late Captain Lewis, of the Navy, <i>who had</i> it from a Mr. Goodwin, who
heard it from Mr. Lyon, the British Consul at Pernambuco, with whom
you undertake to say I lived, represented me as stating, "that, if the
Chesapeake had been prepared for action, I would not have resisted the
attack of the Leopard; assigning, as a reason, that I knew, as also did
our government, that there were deserters on board the Chesapeake; and
that I said to Mr. Lyon, further, that the President of the United States
knew there were deserters on board, and of the intention of the British
ship to take them, and that the ship was ordered out under these circumstances,
with a view to bring about a contest which might embroil the two
nations in a war."</p>

<p>The whole of this, Sir, I pronounce to be a falsehood, a ridiculous,
malicious, absurd, improbable falsehood, which can never be credited
by any man that does not feel a disposition to impress on the opinion
of the public that I am an idiot. That I should two years after the
affair of the Chesapeake, make such a declaration, when every proof
that could be required of a contrary disposition on the part of the
Chief Magistrate had been given, cannot receive credit from any one,
but those that are disposed to consider me such a character as you
would represent me to be. I did not live with Mr. Lyon, nor did I
ever hold a conversation with him so indelicate as the one stated in
captain Lewis' letter would have been. And with what object could I
have made such a communication? Mr. Lyon would naturally have felt
a contempt for a man that would have suffered himself to have been
made a tool of in so disgraceful an affair. I found Mr. Lyon transacting
business in Pernambuco: he produced to me a letter from Mr. Hill, the
American consul in that country, recommending him as entitled to the
confidence of his countrymen, every one of whom, in that port, put their
business into his hands. I did the same, and thus commenced our acquaintance;
he was kind and friendly to me, but never in any respect
indelicate, as would have been, in a high degree, such conversation between
us. Of Mr. Goodwin I know nothing. I have never seen him in
all my life, nor do I conceive that his hearsay evidence can ever be of
any kind of consequence against me; I was the first that informed the
President, and the Secretary of the Navy, that such a letter was in the
Department, even before I had seen it; and, again, if the mere oral
testimony of a British agent was to be considered as evidence sufficient
to arraign an American officer, I think the navy would quickly be in
such a state, as it might be desirable for their nation to place it in. As
to the <i>impressions</i> made upon the mind of captain Lewis, from this <i>information</i>,
and the "strong remarks" he made upon the subject, which
you have thought proper to quote, they by no means establish the <i>correctness</i>
of that information; but only go to shew the effect it produced
upon the mind of an individual, who seems to have imbibed a prejudice
against me, no otherwise to be accounted for, except your acquaintance
with him. He is now in his grave, and I am perfectly disposed <i>there</i> to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;14]</span>
let him rest; you must, however, have been hard pressed indeed, to be
compelled to resort to such flimsy grounds as those, a degree weaker
than even second handed testimony, to support your charges against me.
These communications, you observe, are now in the archives of the Navy
Department. Of this fact, Sir, I had long been apprized; and had
you, when searching the records of that Department for documents to
injure my character, looked a little further back, you would perhaps
have found others calculated to produce a very different effect. Of my
desire to return to the United States, during the late war, there are certificates
in the Navy Department of the first respectability, which, if you
had been disposed to find and quote, are perhaps laying on the same
shelf from whence you took those, that you appear so anxious to bring
to public view; I mean my letter applying for service, as soon as an
opportunity offered, after the term of my suspension expired; and one
letter, above all, <i>you</i> should not have passed over unnoticed, that which
you received from my hand of May, 1803, addressed to the Secretary of
the Navy, which was one of the principal causes of your obtaining the
first command that you were ever honored with, and as you may
have forgotten it, I will remind you, on this occasion, that, but little
more than one month previous to the date of that letter, I by my advice
and arguments, saved you from resigning the service of your country
in a pet, because you were removed from the first lieutenancy of the
New York, to that of second of the Chesapeake; but all this and much
more is now forgotten by <i>you</i>, yet there are others that recollect those
circumstances, and the history of your conduct to me will outlive you,
let my fate be what it may. The affair of the Chesapeake did certainly
"excite," and ought to have excited, the indignant feeling of the nation
towards Great Britain; but, however it may have justified a declaration
of war against that power, it was not, as you assert "every one admits,"
one of the principal causes of the late war. That it did not take
place, sir, until <i>five years</i> after, when that affair had been amicably and
of course honourably adjusted between the two nations. I mention this
fact, not on account of its importance, but because you have laid so much
stress on that "affair," as a reason why I ought to have returned home
during the late war, and to shew that, although it <i>did</i> happen to be
your fortunate lot to have an opportunity of being in the foremost rank,
on that occasion, of which you seem inclined to vaunt, you are ignorant
even of the causes which led to it. Having, in your letter of the 5th
inst. abandoned the charge of my having sailed under "British license,"
after the commencement of the late war, in consequence of information
received by you from a gentleman entitled to the fullest credit, that I
was not afloat, until after the peace, consequently the report which you
noticed of my having sailed under British license, must be unfounded.
I have only to remark, on this head, that in advancing a charge against
me of so serious a nature, and designed and so well calculated, as it was,
to affect, materially, my reputation, not only as an officer of the navy,
but as a citizen of the United States, you should first have ascertained
that it was founded on <i>fact</i>, and not on rumour, which you so
much <i>harp</i> upon; and that upon a proper investigation you would have
discovered your other accusations to be equally groundless. For my not
returning home during the late war, I do not hold myself, to use your
own expressions, "in any way accountable to you," Sir. It would be
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;15]</span>
for the government, I should suppose, to take notice of my absence, if
they deemed it reprehensible; and they no doubt would have done
so, had not the circumstances of the case, in their estimation, justified it.
That they are perfectly satisfied upon this point, I have good reason to
believe, and trust I shall be able to satisfy my country also. The President's
personal conduct to me, and the memorial of the Virginia Delegation
in Congress, to him, prove how I stand with those high characters,
your opinion, notwithstanding, to the contrary. I deny, Sir, that I
ever was "urged" by my friends, as you in mockery term them, to return
home during the late war, nor could it have been requisite for me to
have been "urged" to do so by any one. Laying patriotism out of the
question, as you observe, as well as the reasons why you think "it behoved
me" to adopt that course, there were other incentives strong
enough, God knows, to excite a desire on my part to return; and I should
have returned, Sir, but for circumstances beyond my control, which is not
incumbent on me to explain to <i>you</i>.</p>

<p>Had the many opportunities really presented themselves which you
allege were "every day occurring," of which I might have availed myself
to return to my country, in privateers or other fast sailing merchant
vessels, from France and other places, but of which you produce
no other proof than random assertion, on which most of your other
charges rest? There were no such opportunities, as you say were
"every day occurring;" no, not one within my reach, and for some
considerable time after the news of the war arrived in Denmark, it was
not believed that it would continue six months; but, if I had received
the slightest intimation from the department that I should have been
employed on my return, I should have considered no sacrifice too great,
no exertion within my power should have been omitted to obtain so desirable
an object, as any mark of my country's confidence would have
been to me in such a moment; a gun boat, under my own orders, would
not have been refused; but what hope had I, when my letter of application
for service was not even honored by an answer. In regard to
the John Adams, I do not deem it proper on this occasion to explain my
reasons for making the attempt to return in that ship; but whenever I
am called on by any person properly authorized to make the enquiry,
I am confident that I shall convince them, that I had good reason to believe
that I should obtain a passage in her, notwithstanding your great
knowledge on the occasion.</p>

<p>You say, by absenting myself, <i>for years</i>, from the country, without
leave from the government, I "subjected myself to be stricken from
the rolls." I knew also, by the 10th article of the act for the better
government of the navy, that all persons in the navy holding intercourse
with an enemy, became subject to the severest punishment
known to the law; and that, for these offences, as you are pleased to
term them, "I have not received, to your knowledge, even a reprimand;"
but I presume if I have not it is not your fault. What kind
and humane forbearance this, after what I have already endured! But,
sir, as you seem to be so very intelligent upon other points, pray tell
me where was the necessity of my asking for a furlough until the period
of my suspension expired, or even after having reported myself
for duty without being noticed. As to the charge of my holding
intercourse with the enemy, I am at a loss to conceive to what you
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;16]</span>
allude, and should degrade myself by giving it any other reply than
to pronounce it&mdash;if you mean to insinuate there was any unlawful or
improper communication on my part with the government, or any
individual of Great Britain, as a <i>false</i> and <i>foul</i> aspersion on my character,
which no conduct or circumstance of my life, however it might
be tortured by your malice or ingenuity, can, in any manner, justify
or support. You say, also, that you <i>do know</i> "that my pay, even
during my absence, was <i>continued to me</i>." It is not the fact, sir; I never,
and until very recently since my return, received but half pay.
This part of your letter I should not have regarded, were it not to
shew with what boldness, facility, and <i>sang froid</i>, you can make assertions
unsustained even by the shadow of truth; but, if you had made
yourself acquainted with the circumstances relative to my <i>half pay</i>,
you would have found that not one cent of it was received by me. The
government was so good as to pay the amount to my unfortunate female
family, whose kindest entertainment you have frequently enjoyed.
Poor unfortunate children! whose ancestors, every man of
them, did contribute every disposable shilling of their property, many
of them their lives, and all of them their best exertions, to establish
the independence of their country, should now be told that the
small amount of my half pay was considered, by an officer of high
rank, too much for them! You have been good enough to inform me
that, on my return to this country, my "<i>efforts</i>," as you have been
pleased to call them, "to re-instate myself in the service were known,
and became a subject of conversation with officers, as well as others;"
and, but for those "efforts," it is <i>more than probable</i> you would not have
<i>spoken of me</i>. This would indeed have displayed a wonderful degree
of lenity and courtesy on your part, of which I could not have failed to be
duly sensible. But, sir, I beg leave to ask how, and where, did you get
your information, that such "efforts" were made by me; and even admit
they were, why should you <i>alone</i>, disclaiming, as you pretend to do, all
"<i>personal enmity</i>" against me, have made yourself so <i>particularly busy</i> on the
occasion? Was it because your inflated pride led you to believe that the
weight of your influence was greater than that of any other officer of the
navy, or that you were more tenacious of its honor and "respectability," than
the rest of the officers were? You assure me, however, 'that, in the interchange
of opinion with other officers respecting me, you have never met
with more than one who did not entirely concur with you in the opinion
you have expressed of me.' Indeed! and what is the reason? It is
because I suppose you are most commonly attended by a train of dependents,
who, to enjoy the sunshine of your favour, act as <i>caterers</i>
for your vanity; and, revolving around you like <i>satellites</i>, borrow
their chief consequence from the countenance you may <i>condescend</i> to
bestow upon them. You, at length, arrive at the main point; the "object"
of my letter of the 23d ultimo, which you might have reached
by a much <i>shorter route</i>, and have saved me the fatigue of being compelled,
in self defence, to travel with you so far as you have gone.
The language of defiance, represented to have been used by you, 'that
you would cheerfully meet me in the field, and hoped I would yet act
like a man,' are disavowed by you. And you further deny having ever
invited me to the field, or expressed a hope that I would call you
out; but you observe that, 'being informed by a gentleman with
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;17]</span>
whom I had <i>conferred</i> upon the subject, that I left Norfolk, for the
seat of government, some time before our June correspondence, with
the intention of calling you out, you stated to that gentleman, as you
have to <i>all others</i> with whom you have conversed upon the subject, that,
if I made the call, you would meet me; but that, upon all scores,
you would be much better pleased to have nothing to do with me.'
I certainly do not <i>exactly</i> know who that intermeddling gentleman was,
with whom you say I "conferred;" but, if I may be allowed a conjecture,
I think I can recognize in him the self same officious <i>gentleman</i>,
who, I am creditably informed, originated the report of your having
made use of the gasconading expressions you have disowned:&mdash;In
this respect I may be mistaken. Be this, however, as it may, I never
gave him, or any other person, to understand that my visit to Washington
last spring, was for the purpose of "calling you out," nor <i>did</i> I
go there with <i>any such view</i>.</p>

<p>How you can reconcile your affecting indifference towards me, in the
remark "that, on all scores, you would be much better pleased to have
nothing to do with me," with the very active part which, it is generally
known, and which your own letter clearly evinces, you have taken
against me, I am at a loss to conceive. No, sir, you feel not so much
unconcern as you pretend and wish it to be believed you do, in regard
to the course of conduct my honor and my injuries may, in my judgment,
require me to pursue. You have a <i>motive</i>, not to be concealed
from the world, for all you have done or said, or for any future endeavors
you may make, to bar my "re-admission" into the service. It is
true, you have never given me a direct, formal and written invitation,
to meet you in the field, such as one gentleman of honor <i>ought</i> to send
to another. But, if your own admissions, that you had "incautiously
said you would meet me if I wished it," and "that if you had not
<i>pledged yourself</i>, you might re-consider the subject," and all this too
without any provocation on my part, or the most distant intimation from
me that I had a desire to meet you, do not amount to a challenge, I
cannot comprehend the object or import of such declarations&mdash;made as
they were in the face of the world; and to those in particular, whom
you knew would not only communicate them to me, but give them circulation;
under all the circumstances of the case, I consider you as having
thrown down the gauntlet, and I have no hesitation in accepting it.
This is, however, a point which it will not be for you or me to decide,
nor do I view it as of any other importance than as respects the privilege
allowed to the challenged party in relation to the choice of weapons,
distance, &amp;c. about which I feel not more "fastidious," I assure you, sir,
than you do; nor do I claim any advantage whatever, which I have
no right to insist upon; could I stoop so low as to solicit any. I know
you too well to believe you would have any inclination to concede
them. All I demand is to be placed upon equal grounds with you;
such as two honorable men may decide upon, <i>as just and proper</i>.
Upon the subject of duelling, I perfectly coincide with the opinions
you have expressed. I consider it as a barbarous practice which ought
to be exploded from civilized society; but, sir, there may be causes of
such extraordinary and aggravated insult and injury, received by an individual,
as to render an appeal to arms, on his part, absolutely necessary;
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;18]</span>
mine I conceive to be a case of that description, and I feel myself
constrained, by every tie that binds me to society, by all that can make
life desirable to me, to resort to this mode of obtaining that redress due to
me, at your hands, as the only alternative which now seems to present
itself for the preservation of my honor.</p>

<p>To conclude: you say, "from my manner of proceeding, it appears
to you that I have come to the determination to fight some one, and that
I have selected you for that purpose." To say nothing of the vanity
you display, and the importance you seem to attach to yourself, in thus
intimating, that, being resolved to <i>fight myself</i> into favor, I could no otherwise
do so than by fixing upon you, the very reverse of which you
infer is the fact; I never wished to fight in this way, and, had you
permitted me to remain at rest, I should not have disturbed <i>you</i>; I
should have pursued the "even tenor of my way," without regarding
you at all. But all this would not have suited your ambitious views.
You have <i>hunted</i> me out, have persecuted me with all the power and
influence of your office, and have declared your determination to attempt
to drive me from the navy, if I should make any "efforts" to be employed,
and for what purpose, or from what other motive than to obtain
my rank, I know not: if my life will give it to you, you shall have an
opportunity of obtaining it. And now, sir, I have only to add, that, if
you will make known your determination, and the name of your friend,
I will give that of mine, in order to complete the necessary arrangements
to a final close of this affair. I can make no other apology for
the apparent tardiness of this communication, than merely to state, that,
being on very familiar terms with my family, out of tenderness to their
feelings, I have written under great restraint.</p>

<p class="center">I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="h2">No. 10</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Washington</span>, <i>29th December, 1819</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Your communication of the 30th ultimo reached me as I was
on the eve of my departure for the north; whence I did not return
till the 22d inst. It was my determination, on the receipt of your letter,
not to notice it; but upon mature reflection, I conceive, that as I have
suffered myself to be drawn into this unprofitable discussion, I ought not
to leave the false colouring and calumnies, which you have introduced
into your letter, unanswered. You state, that a much more laconic reply to
your letter of 23d October would have served your purpose. Of this I
have no doubt; and to have insured such an answer, you had only to
make a laconic call. I had already informed you of the course I had felt
myself bound to pursue respecting you, and of the reasons which induced
my conduct, and that, if you required it, I would overcome my own
disinclination and fight you. Instead of calling me out for injuries which
you chose to insist that I have heaped upon you, <i>you</i> have thought fit to
enter into this war of words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;19]</span>
I reiterate to you, that I have not challenged, nor do I intend to
challenge you. I do not consider it essential to my reputation that I
should notice any thing which may come from you, the more particularly,
when you declare your sole object, in wishing to draw the challenge
from me, is, that you may avail yourself of the advantages which
rest with the challenged. It is evident, that you think, or your friends
for you, that a fight will help you; but in fighting, you wish to incur the
least possible risk. Now, sir, not believing that a fight of this nature
will raise me at all in public estimation, but may even have a contrary
effect, I do not feel at all disposed to remove the difficulties that lay in
your way. If we fight, it must be of your seeking; and you must take
all the risk and all the inconvenience which usually attend the challenger,
in such cases.</p>

<p>You deny having made the communication to the British consul at
Pernambuco, which captain Lewis and Mr. Goodwin have represented.
The man capable of making such a communication, would not hesitate
in denying it; and, until you can bring forward some testimony, other
than your own, you ought not to expect that the testimony of those gentlemen
will be discredited. As to the veracity of the British consul, I
can prove, if necessary, that you have, yourself, vouched for that.</p>

<p>You offer, as your excuse for not returning to your country, during
our war with England, that you had not been invited home by the then
Secretary, notwithstanding you had written him, expressive of your
wishes to be employed. You state, that, if you "had received the
slightest intimation from the department, that you would have been
employed on your return, you would have considered no sacrifice too
great, no exertion within your power should have been omitted to obtain
so desirable an object." From this, I would infer, that, in consequence
of not receiving this intimation, you did not make the exertions in your
power to return, and this I hold to be an insufficient excuse. You do
not pretend to have made any attempt, except by the way of the cartel,
the John Adams. You cannot believe, that reporting yourself to the
Department, at the distance of 4000 miles, when the same conveyance
which brought your letter would have brought yourself, will be received
as evincing sufficient zeal to join the arms of your country; and besides,
you say it was not believed, for a considerable time after the news of
war arrived in Denmark, that the war would last six months. With
those impressions, you must have known, that it would have occupied
at least that time for your letter to have arrived at the Department,
you to receive an answer, and then to repair to America. You deny
that the opportunities of returning were frequent. The custom house
entries at Baltimore and New York alone, from the single port of Bordeaux,
will show nearly an hundred arrivals; and it is well known, that
it required only a few days to perform the journey from Copenhagen to
Bordeaux, by the ordinary course of post. You deny having been advised
to return to this country, by your friends, during the war. Mr.
Cook, of Norfolk, your relative, says he wrote to you to that effect; and
Mr. Forbes, then our consul at Copenhagen, who is now at this place,
says he urged you in person to do so.</p>

<p>You have charged the officers who concur with me in opinion respecting
your claims to service, as being my satellites. I think I am not
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;20]</span>
mistaken, when I inform you, that all the officers of our grade, your
superiors as well as inferiors, with the exception of one who is your
junior concur in the opinion, that you ought not to be employed again,
whilst the imputations, which now lie against you, remain; nor have
they been less backward than myself in expressing their opinions.</p>

<p>Your charge of my wishing to obtain your rank, will apply to all who
are your juniors, with as much force as to myself. You never have
interfered with me in the service, and, at the risk of being esteemed by
you a little vain, I must say, I do not think you ever will. Were I disposed
to kill out of my way, as you have been pleased to insinuate, those
who interfere with my advancement, there are others, my superiors,
who I consider fairly barring my pretensions; and it would serve such
purpose better, to begin with them. You say, you were the means of
obtaining me the first command I ever had in service. I deny it: I feel
that I owe my standing to my exertions only.</p>

<p>Your statement, that your advice prevented me from resigning on a
former occasion, is equally unfounded. I have never, since my first admission
into the navy, contemplated resigning; and, instead of being
ordered, as you state, from the 1st lieutenancy of the New York, to the
2d of the Chesapeake, Commodore Chauncy, who was then flag captain,
can testify, that I was solicited to remain as 1st lieutenant of the flag
ship: and I should have remained as such, had it not been for the demand
which the government of Malta made, for the delivery of the
persons who had been concerned in the affair of honour, which led to
the death of a British officer. It was deemed necessary to send all the
persons, implicated in that affair, out of the way; and I went home in
the Chesapeake, as a passenger.</p>

<p>You have been pleased to allude to my having received the hospitality
of your family. The only time I recollect having been at your house,
was on my arrival from the Mediterranean in the Congress, fourteen
years past. You came on board, and dined with me; and invited the
Tunisian ambassador and myself to spend the evening with you at
Hampton. I accepted your invitation. Your having now reminded me
of it, tends very much towards removing the weight of obligation I
might otherwise have felt on this score.</p>

<p>You speak of the good conduct of your ancestors. As your own conduct
is under discussion, and not theirs, I cannot see how their former
good character can at all serve your present purpose. Fortunately for
our country, every man stands upon his own merit.</p>

<p>You state that the "Virginia delegation in Congress" had presented
a memorial in your favour. I would infer from this, that all, or the
greater part of the Virginia delegation, had interposed in your behalf.
This, sir, is not the fact. A few of them, I am informed, did take an
interest in your case; but, being informed of the charges existing
against you, of which they were before unapprised, they did not press
farther your claims. From the knowledge I have of the high-minded
gentlemen that compose the Virginia delegation, if they would take the
trouble to examine your case, I should, for my own part, be entirely
satisfied to place the honour of the service upon their decision.</p>

<p>You offer as your excuse for permitting four months to intervene
between our June correspondence, (with which, from your letter, you
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;21]</span>
appeared to be satisfied) and your letter of 23d October, your indisposition.
I am authorized in saying, that, for the greater part of the four
months, you were out attending to your usual avocations.</p>

<p>Your offering your life to me would be quite affecting, and might (as
you evidently intend) excite sympathy, if it were not ridiculous. It will
not be lost sight of, that your jeopardizing your life depends upon yourself,
and not upon me; and is done with a view to fighting your own
character up. I have now to inform you, that I shall pay no further
attention to any communication you may make to me, other than a direct
call to the field.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Your letter of the 29th ult. I have received. In it you say that
you have now to inform me that you shall pay no further attention to
any communication that I may make to you other than a direct call to
the field; in answer to which I have only to reply, that whenever you
will consent to meet me on fair and equal grounds, that is, such as two
honourable men may consider just and proper, you are at liberty to view
this as that call; the whole tenor of your conduct to me justifies this
course of proceeding on my part; as for your charges and remarks, I
regard them not, particularly your sympathy; you know not such a feeling&mdash;I
cannot be suspected of making the attempt to excite it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I have received your communication of the 16th, and am at a
loss to know what your intention is. If you intended it as a challenge,
I accept it, and refer you to my friend Com. Bainbridge, who is fully authorized
by me to make any arrangement he pleases, as regards weapons,
mode, or distance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Your letter of the 29th of December found me confined to bed,
with a violent bilious fever, and it was eight days after its arrival before
I was able to read it; the fever, however, about that time, left me, and
my convalescence appeared to promise a moderately quick recovery.
I, therefore, wrote you my note of the 16th ultimo; in two days after
I relapsed, and have had a most violent attack, which has reduced me
very low, but as soon as I am in a situation to write, you shall hear from
me to the point.</p>
